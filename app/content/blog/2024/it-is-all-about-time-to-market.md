# It is all about time to market

Recently, my sister became a mom, and motherhood comes with new problems that need solutions. Stay with me as I explain my point.

She gave me a list of issues and suggested a website or app could solve them. We brainstormed ideas like:

- Tracking diaper changes (pee/poop) to see if the baby's output is normal
- Daily, weekly, and monthly reports
- Counting feedings and which breast was used
- Tracking the baby's sleep duration
- Estimating diaper costs
- Medication reminders
- Recording the baby's temperature

I then searched the Play Store and found a solution that's been around since 2015. This simple app solves her problems and costs only 12 reais (BRL) (~$2.1 USD) per year. It boasts over 1 million downloads and 100,000 reviews, with 95% of them positive. It likely requires minimal maintenance from the developer, who probably doesn't need a team.

code is just commodity and
[sometimes, success is about being in the right place at the right time](https://websim.ai/c/aKIsBIa3aaphyYaJB) with the right knowledge to build.
