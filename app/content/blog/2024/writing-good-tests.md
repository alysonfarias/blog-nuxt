# Writing Good Unit Tests

##

- AAA
  Arrange: Set up the necessary conditions and inputs for the test (e.g., mock objects, input data).
  Act: Execute the code or function being tested.
  Assert: Verify that the outcome matches the expected result.

- Only test one thing

- Focus on the essence of a test when arranging

- keep your number of assertions ("expects") low
